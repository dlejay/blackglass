          <div class="mission-explanation">
            <p>
              <strong>Less than 5% of commercial roofs in the UK are equipped with solar.</strong>
              This isn't an oversight; it's a massive, untapped economic
              opportunity. For decades, this potential has been locked behind
              significant financial complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Property owners and landlords face prohibitive upfront capital
              costs, a confusing maze of subsidy applications, and rigid
              financing models that simply aren’t fit for purpose. The result is
              inertia—and a missed opportunity for both the property owner and
              the UK grid as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blackglass Capital is built to solve this one problem. We are not
              a traditional lender; we are a dedicated finance partner. We have
              streamlined the entire process, from initial energy assessment to
              final installation, by removing these barriers. Our platform
              connects property owners with rapid, efficient capital, handling
              the complexities so you don't have to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to turn every commercial roof from an idle
              liability into a source of energy and stable, long-term
							revenue.
							<strong>We make solar funding so simple, there is no longer any
											reason to leave this potential untapped.</strong>
